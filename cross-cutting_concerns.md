# Cross-cutting concerns

_for DG2DMM™ (Data Governance to Data Management Maturity)_

1. **Fit-for-Purpose and Value** – Every decision, process and standard must serve a clear purpose and demonstrable business value.
2. **Progressive Maturity** – Governance builds on continuity and evidence; managed data matures stepwise from raw to productized.
3. **Product Thinking and Boundaries** – Data treated as products with ownership, lifecycle, contracts, and explicit boundaries.
4. **Ownership and Accountability** – Responsibilities are federated but explicit; roles are active participants in workflows, not symbolic.
5. **Computational Governance and Automation** – Policies, standards, and workflows are executable as code; metadata is captured automatically.
6. **Workflow and Decision Governance** – Key governance decisions (access, quality, deprecation, change) happen through standardized workflows, with clear notifications and audit trails.
7. **SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs** – Service indicators and objectives are first-class outputs of data products; contractual SLAs are distinct but informed by them.
8. **Auditability and Transparency** – Every workflow, change, and exception must be traceable, logged and reviewable.
9. **Quality and Risk Management** – Quality is measured as fit-for-purpose and risk-based; critical checks block publication; others provide warnings.
10. **Access and Use Governance** – Access is purpose-based, least-privilege, time-bound and periodically recertified; “appropriate use” is enforced by design.
11. **Privacy, Security and Sovereignty** – Privacy by design, enforceable data subject rights, retention rules, data sovereignty and integral security in delivery.
12. **Lifecycle and Change Management** – Standards cover versioning, lifecycle statuses, breaking changes, deprecation, coexistence with legacy and migration paths.
13. **Observability and Operational Health** – Telemetry, incident response, dashboards, cost monitoring and product health metrics are visible and actionable.
14. **Platform and Interoperability** - Governance is embedded in platform capabilities, not tools; APIs, open interfaces, guardrails, and composable building blocks enable interoperability.
15. **Adoption, Usability and Continuous Learning** – Governance must be usable: living documentation, onboarding and education, UX that supports self-service, roadmap-driven growth, measurement through SLIs, and refinement through feedback loops.
